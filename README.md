A web-based low-code choose-your-own-adventure engine written in PHP with:
- dynamic variables
- choice requirements

- and more!

## Installation

To install the engine, clone the repository and start a PHP server in the root directory.

### Linux (recommended)
To install PHP and the engine on a Linux machine, run the following commands in the terminal. The commands will install PHP and clone the repository into the default web directory.
```bash
sudo apt install php git
cd /var/www/html
git clone https://github.com/dotargz/novel-engine .
```

### Windows
Follow the instructions on the [official PHP website](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.windows.tools.php) to install PHP. Then, after [installing git](https://git-scm.com/), run the following commands in the command prompt to clone the repository and start the server.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dotargz/novel-engine
cd novel-engine
php -S localhost:80
```

## Usage

To customize the story, edit the `story.json` file, which contains the story's structure. The engine will read the file and display the story to the user.
